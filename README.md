# Graphite Omnibus

This is an [fpm-cookery](https://github.com/bernd/fpm-cookery) Omnibus recipe
that builds a Python interpreter and then packages Graphite and its dependencies
into it.

## Note

This is extremely alpha, and should be improved. For example, the following would be good:

- support for systems other than Ubuntu 12.04
- a build lab using Docker or Vagrant or something
- hosting packages for people to make life easier
